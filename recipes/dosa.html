   <h4> Description </h4>
   <p>A dosa is a thin pancake or crepe originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but now have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. 
       Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar in recent times. 
       Other accompaniments include chutney powder (a fine groundnut and lentil powder).</p>

                Instead of adding regular rice, you can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice as I have shown in the video.
